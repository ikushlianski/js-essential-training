# Task

## Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. do `npm install` from the root directory
3. go to any folder by JS topic. Inside the folder you will see `task.js` file, where you need to write your implementation of the function 
4. launch tests in watch mode by running `npm test`. You will always see 1 test passing and 1 failing. The one that passes is the example solution that you can discover after you implement yours
5. fulfill the task until 2 tests pass
6. if you know multiple ways to do the same task, feel free to try them all. This will make you a better developer!
7. check the suggested solution against yours

## Notes
- try maintaining balance between code clarity and the number of lines of code
