# Task

## Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. do `npm install` from the root directory
3. from your command line, `cd` into any folder by JS topic. For example: `cd tasks/filter-only-truthy` 
4. Inside the folder you will see `task.js` file, where you need to write your implementation of the function 
5. from your directory of choice, launch tests in watch mode by running `npm test`. 
6. You will always see 1 test passing and 1 failing. The one that passes is the example solution that you can discover after you implement yours
   ![Jest tests failing](./img/jest.png)
7. fulfill the task until 2 tests pass
8. if you know multiple ways to do the same task, feel free to try them all. This will make you a better developer!
9. check the suggested solution against yours

## Notes
- try maintaining balance between code clarity and the number of lines of code
